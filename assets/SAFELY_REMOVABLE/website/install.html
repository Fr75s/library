      <h1>Installation</h1>

      <p>Installing this theme is simple, and can be done with the following steps.</p>
      <p>First, download the theme's contents, which can be done by clicking the button below, or by downloading the zip file <a href="https://github.com/Fr75s/library">from the github page.</a></p>

      <a class="centered button" href="https://github.com/Fr75s/library/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download</a>

      <p>Next, extract the contents of the .zip file to your themes folder: <a href="https://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes/">refer to the official Pegasus documentation for more information</a> as to where exactly the themes folder is on your system.</p>

      <p>Finally, you may remove the SAFELY_REMOVABLE folder that's in the assets folder within the theme's folder, as it only provides screenshots and other resources not required to run the theme.</p>
