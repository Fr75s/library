      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>Library is a clean, modern interface for <a href="http://pegasus-frontend.org/">Pegasus Frontend</a> that aims to provide a useful theme that makes it quick to find and play games. Inspired partly by the Steam Deck's UI, this interface focuses more on displaying box art in organized categories with a minimal amount of text.</p>

      <p>Library aims to be easy to use once Pegasus itself is set up. While Pegasus Frontend is not the friendliest in terms of configuration, <a href="https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper">tools are available that can help you to at least get metadata for the theme.</a>


      <h1>Features</h1>
      <h2>Customizable</h2>
      <p>Library has several toggleable options which allow you to easily modify parts of the theme. Options include a light mode, expanding the game width and more. Of course, you can always customize the QML files; <a href="https://github.com/Fr75s/library/blob/main/MODIFICATIONS.md">we even provide a guide for some quick modifications to get started.</a></p>

      <h2>Little Hassle</h2>
      <p>Library is a theme that is quite simple to use, making it easy to search through your game library. It also uses little metadata: only the title, box art and another art/screenshot is needed for games to fully function.</p>

      <h2>Advanced</h2>
      <p>Library has several advanced features which other themes don't have, such as mouse-based navigation and a virtual keyboard for searching. These advanced features enhance your experience.</p>


      <h1>Special Thanks</h1>
      <p>I referred to other projects throughout the creation of this theme. These projects are listed below.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/valsou/neoretro">https://github.com/valsou/neoretro</a>: The framework I built this theme off of, used for the separate page file system and Colcon.qml.

          <a href="https://github.com/TigraTT-Driver/shinretro">https://github.com/TigraTT-Driver/shinretro</a>: A theme which provided the functionality for portrait-style steam game box art and more. I didn't find out about this theme until Library was mostly complete.

          <a href="https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/clearOS">https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/clearOS</a>: A theme providing part of the search functionality of the theme.
