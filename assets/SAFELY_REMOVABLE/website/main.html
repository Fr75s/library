      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>Library is a clean, modern interface for Pegasus Frontend that aims to provide a theme which doesn't emphasize text. Inspired partly by the Steam Deck's UI, this interface focuses more on providing the box art in organized categories, with little textual metadata.</p>


      <h1>Features</h1>
      <h2>Customizable</h2>
      <p>Library has several toggleable options which allow you to easily modify parts of the theme. Options include a light mode, expanding the game width and more. Of course, you can always customize the QML files.</p>

      <h2>Little Hassle</h2>
      <p>Library is a theme that is quite simple to use, making it easy to search through your game library. It also uses little metadata: only the title, box art and another art/screenshot is needed for games to fully function.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
      <p>Library has several advanced features which other themes don't have, such as mouse-based navigation and a virtual keyboard for searching. These advanced features enhance your experience.</p>
