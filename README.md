## A Clean, Modern, Bigscreen Interface for Pegasus Frontend

If you are looking to use this theme, [Check out the website for this theme here.](https://fr75s.github.io/library/assets/SAFELY_REMOVABLE/website/main.html)

Library is a clean, modern interface for [Pegasus Frontend](http://pegasus-frontend.org) that aims to provide a theme which doesn't emphasize text. Inspired partly by the Steam Deck's UI, this interface focuses more on providing the box art in organized categories, with little textual metadata.

## Special Thanks

I used other themes as references while building Library. These themes are listed below.

- https://github.com/valsou/neoretro: The framework I built this theme off of, used for the separate page file system and Colcon.qml.
- https://github.com/TigraTT-Driver/shinretro: A theme which provided the functionality for portrait-style steam game box art and more. I didn't find out about this theme until Library was mostly complete.
- https://github.com/PlayingKarrde/clearOS: A theme providing part of the search functionality of the theme.
